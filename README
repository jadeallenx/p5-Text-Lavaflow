Text-Lavaflow

Text::Lavaflow turns text processed by Text::Markup into HTML5 compliant 
slides using the same CSS and Javascript written by the HTML5 Rocks team
at Google.

It is more or less a port of the Python program 'landslide' and reuses
both the themes from that application, as well as borrows liberally from
the landslide provided base HTML5 template "base.html".

As of this writing, Text::Markup supports the following markup styles:

 * Markdown
 * MultiMarkdown
 * Pod
 * MediaWiki
 * Textile
 * Trac

And if you need something not listed here, you can easily subclass Text::Markup
and drop in support for it.
